# API
Allows developers to include CloudCoins in their projects 


There are three catagories of API

1. RAIDA

2. SkyWallet

3. CloudBank (also does RAIDA and Skywallet)


The CloudBank is the most flexible, private and perhaps the most secure. 

## CloudBank

Anyone can create a CloudBank on their computer. They can put this computer in a secure room in your business or even in your house. 

The CloudBank is the CloudCoin Wallet with the web-server turned on so that it can receive RPC (Remote Procedure Calls).

The CloudBank allows you to access the funds in your from anywhere in the world. 

To turn on CloudBank you will need to download and install the CloudCoin Wallet and go to Tools > CloudBank and turn on the server. You 
will then need to set the port number. Then open that port number on your home router so that it forwards to your computer.
