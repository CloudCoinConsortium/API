# CloudBank

The CloudBank API allows you to send commands to a CloudCoin Wallet on a remote computer. To access your remote
computer, you will need a "key" file that contains the URL of your CloudCoin Wallet, the port number your CloudCoin Wallet is listening on,
the account name and account password. 

You can command your CloudBank to pown a coin that you send it, send you a coin, view reciepts, or even transfer from your skywallets.
